Generates random 3SAT problems and reduces them to an independent set problem as described in _Algorithm Design_ by Jon Klenberg and Eva Tardos

# Usage
Create a new venv, pip install requirements.txt and then run the file

Note that after prompting for size (size is the number of clauses in the 3SAT), the program will output a new graph each time the graph window is closed until it receives a keyboard interrupt or is killed in some other way.
